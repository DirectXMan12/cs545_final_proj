- TDImage (3d_img.*) := Template class representing an image in 3-dimensional space, has cols, rows, colors, and depth
- TomoImage (tomo_img.*) := Template class representing a series of Tomographical projections, has cols, rows, colors, and positions (planes)

both libraries compile without errors, but I have not gotten a chance to try them out, so let me know if you get any errors -- Solly
