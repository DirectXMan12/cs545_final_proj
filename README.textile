h2. Utility Libraries

- TDImage (3d_img.*) := Template class representing an image in 3-dimensional space, has cols, rows, colors, and depth
- TomoImage (tomo_img.*) := Template class representing a series of Tomographical projections, has cols, rows, colors, and positions (planes)
- dft.h := dft-related functionality
- img_iters.h := @/FOREACH_PIXEL(.*)/@ macros for iterating over the pixels in different types of images
- err_macros.h := contains the POST_ERR, POST_WARN, and POST_INFO macros, which take partial stream code as arguements (e.g. @POST_ERR("there was a problem at pixel" << pixel_num)@)

h2. Status of Main Code

* everything compiles
* not yet actually tested
* currently outputs quasi-final 3DImage (WPI img format stacked on top of each other, pretty much)
